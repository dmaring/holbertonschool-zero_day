# Holberton Day Zero
### This project is to practice learning vagrant, emacs, and vi.

What is a virtual machine
In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. 

What is vagrant
Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments.

Who wrote Vagrant
Vagrant was first started as a personal side-project by Mitchell Hashimoto in January 2010.

What is Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a free open-source Linux distribution based on Debian.

What does Ubuntu mean
Ubuntu means "humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".

How to use VMs with Vagrant
Vagrant uses VMs with conjunction of a virtual machine platform like Oracle Virtual Box and VMware.  The VM that you want to use can be specified in the vagrant file or in the CLI.

What does the command uname do
The command "uname" reports information about the system to the console.  If you type in "uname" without any arguments it will print the name of the current user's account.

What is a zero-day
zero-day is mostly used to reference a security vulnerability that has just been discovered by the maintainer or vendor of the software.  Zero-day vulnerabilities are easier to be exploited because fixes/patches to the software are likely not available yet.
